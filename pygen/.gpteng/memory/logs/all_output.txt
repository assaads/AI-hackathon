================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================ Human Message =================================

Request: code the following in python:

code a code parser that extract the information from a codebase and organize them by their corresponding file and folder

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To implement a code parser that extracts information from a codebase and organizes them by their corresponding file and folder, we'll need several components:

1. **File Scanner**: To walk through the directories and identify code files.
2. **Code Parser**: To parse each file and extract the required information.
3. **Data Organizer**: To organize the extracted information based on file and folder.
4. **Main Entrypoint**: To initiate the scanning and parsing process.

Let's start by setting up the project structure and then proceed to implement each component.

### Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `__init__.py`
  - `main.py` (Entrypoint)
  - `file_scanner.py` (File Scanner)
  - `code_parser.py` (Code Parser)
  - `data_organizer.py` (Data Organizer)
- `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)

### Implementation

#### requirements.txt
```
# No external dependencies required for this basic implementation
```

#### src/__init__.py
```python
# This file is intentionally left empty to make Python treat the directory as a package.
```

#### src/main.py
```python
from file_scanner import FileScanner
from code_parser import CodeParser
from data_organizer import DataOrganizer

def main():
    # Define the root directory of the codebase to parse
    root_directory = "./path/to/codebase"
    
    # Initialize components
    scanner = FileScanner(root_directory)
    parser = CodeParser()
    organizer = DataOrganizer()
    
    # Scan for files
    files = scanner.scan()
    
    # Parse files and organize data
    for file_path in files:
        code_data = parser.parse(file_path)
        organizer.organize(file_path, code_data)
    
    # Optionally, display or save the organized data
    organizer.display()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### src/file_scanner.py
```python
import os

class FileScanner:
    def __init__(self, root_directory):
        self.root_directory = root_directory
    
    def scan(self):
        """Walk through the directories starting from root_directory and list all code files."""
        code_files = []
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.root_directory):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith(".py"):  # Assuming we're only interested in Python files
                    code_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
        return code_files
```

#### src/code_parser.py
```python
class CodeParser:
    def parse(self, file_path):
        """Parse the given file and extract relevant information."""
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # For simplicity, we'll just count the number of lines and functions
        lines = content.split('\n')
        num_lines = len(lines)
        num_functions = sum(1 for line in lines if line.strip().startswith('def '))
        
        return {
            'num_lines': num_lines,
            'num_functions': num_functions
        }
```

#### src/data_organizer.py
```python
class DataOrganizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
    
    def organize(self, file_path, code_data):
        """Organize the extracted data by file and folder."""
        self.data[file_path] = code_data
    
    def display(self):
        """Display the organized data."""
        for file_path, code_data in self.data.items():
            print(f"{file_path}: Lines={code_data['num_lines']}, Functions={code_data['num_functions']}")
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
