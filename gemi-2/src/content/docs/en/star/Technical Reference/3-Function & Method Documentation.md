## generateText() Method

The `generateText()` method is a core functionality of the `OpenAIService` class, responsible for sending prompts to the OpenAI API and retrieving generated text responses.

### Syntax

```javascript
generateText(prompt: string): Promise<OpenAIResponse>
```

### Parameters

*   **prompt:** (string) The text prompt or query that will be submitted to the OpenAI API to generate text.

### Return Value

*   **Promise\<OpenAIResponse\>**: A Promise that resolves to an `OpenAIResponse` object. This object encapsulates the API's response, including the generated text and other relevant information.

### Usage Example

```javascript
const openAIService = new OpenAIService('your-api-key');
const prompt = 'Write a poem about the beauty of nature.';

openAIService.generateText(prompt)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.text); // Access the generated poem
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  });
```

### Error Handling

The `generateText()` method may throw exceptions if errors occur during the API request or response processing. It's essential to implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage these situations.

### Additional Notes

*   The `generateText()` method utilizes the `axios` library to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
*   The `OpenAIResponse` type should be defined accurately in your project to represent the structure of the API response.
*   Always respect OpenAI's usage guidelines and rate limits when interacting with their API.
