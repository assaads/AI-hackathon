title: Database Schema: Not Applicable
description: Information regarding the database schema is not relevant to this project.
---

The current Starlight project does not incorporate or rely on a database. The content is primarily managed through Markdown and MDX files within the `src/content/` directory, and the application logic is handled by Astro components and JavaScript code. As a result, a database schema is not applicable in this context.
