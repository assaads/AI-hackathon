## Prerequisites

Before embarking on your Starlight project journey, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** Verify that you have Node.js (version 14 or later) installed. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or yarn:**  A package manager like npm (usually bundled with Node.js) or yarn is necessary for managing project dependencies. 

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the Starlight project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/starlight-project.git
```

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Access the project's root directory:

```bash
cd starlight-project
```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Server:** Initiate the development server by executing the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

2.  **Access the Site:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your Starlight project in action. The development server will automatically reload and reflect any changes you make to the code.

## Project Structure

Gain familiarity with the project's file organization:

*   `public/`: Stores static assets such as images, favicons, and fonts.
*   `src/`: Contains the source code of your project.
    *   `components/`: Houses reusable UI components.
    *   `content/`: Holds the content of your website, typically in Markdown or MDX format.
    *   `layouts/`: Defines the overall layout and structure of your pages.
    *   `pages/`: Contains individual page components.

## Editing Content

1.  **Locate Content Files:** Your primary content resides within the `src/content/` directory.
2.  **Modify Content:** Open the Markdown or MDX files within the `src/content/` directory using your preferred text editor or IDE and make the desired content changes.
3.  **Save Changes:** Save the modified files, and the development server will automatically update the site to reflect your edits.

## Adding New Content

1.  **Create New Files:** To introduce new pages, create new Markdown or MDX files within the `src/content/` directory.
2.  **Define Frontmatter:** Include necessary frontmatter at the beginning of each new file to specify attributes like title and description.
3.  **Add Content:** Write your content in Markdown or MDX format within the files.

## Configuration

The `astro.config.mjs` file allows you to customize various aspects of your Starlight project, including:

*   **Site metadata:** Define the title, description, and other metadata for your site.
*   **Integrations:** Incorporate additional functionalities through integrations like sitemaps and RSS feeds.
*   **Themes:** Apply themes to style your site's appearance.
