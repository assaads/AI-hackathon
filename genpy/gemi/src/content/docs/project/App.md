# Introduction
This guide provides a clear and detailed explanation of the App component used in the Starlight documentation site. The component integrates a simple form layout using Semantic UI React components and local module styling. You will learn about its structure, the components used, and how to interact with the form present within the App component.

# App Component Structure

## Overview
The App component is a React functional component that renders a user interface for a login form. It utilizes various components from the 'semantic-ui-react' package to structure the form and incorporate styling from an SCSS module.

## Components Used
- `Form`: Acts as a container for the form elements.
- `Form.Field`: A wrapper for individual form fields.
- `Button`: Renders a clickable button, used here to submit the form.
- `Checkbox`: Provides a checkbox input option.
- `Card` and `Menu`: Imported but not utilized within the given code snippet.

## Local Styling
- `styles`: An SCSS module imported as `styles` from './App.module.scss' used for custom component styling.

# Form Layout

## Username Field
- **Label**: Username
- **Input**: A text field that accepts the username input from the user.
- **Placeholder Text**: 'Username'

## Password Field
- **Label**: Password
- **Input**: A text field that accepts the password input from the user.
- **Placeholder Text**: 'Password'

## Remember Me Checkbox
- **Checkbox Label**: "Remember me"

## Submission Button
- **Button Type**: Submit
- **Button Label**: "Submit"

# Styling Overview
The form is styled to be placed within the second column of a grid layout as indicated by the inline style `{{ gridColumn: '2' }}`. The `styles.page` class applied to the container `div` is used to apply specific styles from the SCSS module.

# Conclusion
The App component is a basic example of a login form using Semantic UI React components. It showcases the use of `Form`, `Form.Field`, `Button`, and `Checkbox` within a styled grid layout. For additional customization and functionality, you could introduce form validation, state management for input fields, and event handling for the form submission.

For more information on Semantic UI React components, you can refer to their official documentation: [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

This guide should help you understand the implementation and structure of the App component. If you are looking to extend the functionality or further customize the styling, consider delving into the Semantic UI React documentation and exploring more advanced React patterns.
