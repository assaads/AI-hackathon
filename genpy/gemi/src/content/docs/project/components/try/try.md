# Try Component

The Try component is a simple, customizable block-level element intended for use in React applications. The component is designed to be versatile, allowing developers to pass a `className` prop for customization.

## Usage

To utilize the Try component in your application, you'll need to import it and pass any relevant props as necessary. The component also allows the application of additional CSS classes via the `className` prop for further customization.

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of how to use the Try component within a React application:

```jsx
import { Try } from './path/to/Try';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Try />;
};
```

### With Custom Class

To add a custom class to the Try component, you can pass a `className` prop like this:

```jsx
import { Try } from './path/to/Try';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Try className="myCustomClass" />;
};
```

## Props

Here is the list of props accepted by the Try component along with their types and descriptions:

- `className?`: `string` (optional)
  - This optional prop allows you to add one or more custom CSS class names to the component, which can be used to modify its styling as required.

## Styling

The Try component utilizes CSS modules for styling. The base styling is defined in the `try.module.scss` file, which is imported as `styles` within the component. The `classNames` function is used to combine the base style with any additional classes provided via the `className` prop.

### SCSS Module

The `try.module.scss` file should contain the following base style for the root element:

```scss
.root {
  // Add base styles for the Try component here
}
```

Additional styles can be added to this file as required.

## Guide to Customization

To customize the look and feel of the Try component, follow these steps:

1. Open the `try.module.scss` file.
2. Add or modify the styles for the root class or any other classes you have defined.
3. Use the `className` prop to pass your custom classes when using the component.
