# Contribution Guidelines

## Overview

Contributions are welcome and encouraged to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of the documentation. Whether you're fixing typos, adding new content, or improving existing documentation, your contributions are valuable.

## How to Contribute

1. **Identify areas for improvement**: Explore the documentation to find sections that could benefit from enhancements, clarifications, or additional content. Look for issues labeled as "good first issue" or "help wanted" for starting points.
2. **Fork the repository**: Create a fork of the documentation repository to your own GitHub account.
3. **Create a branch**: Branch off from the main branch to work on your contributions. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the changes you're making.
4. **Make your changes**: Edit the Markdown or MDX files to implement your contributions. Ensure your changes adhere to the existing style and formatting guidelines.
5. **Test your changes**: If applicable, test your contributions to verify they function as expected and do not introduce any regressions.
6. **Commit and push your changes**: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe the modifications made. Push your branch to your forked repository.
7. **Open a pull request**: Submit a pull request from your forked repository's branch to the main repository's main branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and address any feedback from reviewers.
