# Environment Variables 

While the provided codebase does not explicitly demonstrate the usage of environment variables, it's important to recognize their potential role in configuring and managing a Starlight documentation site, particularly when dealing with sensitive information or varying deployment environments. 

## Potential Use Cases

* **API Keys and Secrets**: Store sensitive information, such as API keys for third-party services or database credentials, in environment variables to avoid exposing them directly in your codebase. 
* **Deployment Configurations**: Utilize environment variables to manage settings that differ between development, staging, and production environments. This allows for flexible deployments without modifying the core codebase.
* **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags using environment variables to control the activation or deactivation of specific features during runtime without requiring code changes.

## Setting Environment Variables

The method for setting environment variables depends on your operating system and development environment. Here are some common approaches:

* **`.env` files**: Use a `.env` file in your project's root directory to store environment variables. Ensure that this file is excluded from version control (e.g., added to your `.gitignore` file) to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
* **Operating System Environment**: Set environment variables directly in your operating system's environment settings.
* **Deployment Platform Configuration**: Many deployment platforms, such as cloud providers or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, offer mechanisms for configuring environment variables specific to your deployed applications.

## Example `.env` File Usage

```
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
FEATURE_FLAG_ENABLED=true
```

**Note:** Remember to load the environment variables from the `.env` file using a suitable library or mechanism within your code to make them accessible to your application. 

## Best Practices

* **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information:** Always store secrets and credentials in environment variables to enhance security and prevent accidental exposure.
* **Use clear and descriptive variable names:** Choose meaningful names for your environment variables to improve code readability and maintainability.
* **Document your environment variables:** Maintain documentation that describes the purpose, usage, and possible values of each environment variable used in your project. 
* **Consider using a dotenv library:** Utilize libraries like `dotenv` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to simplify the process of loading environment variables from `.env` files in your Node.js applications.
