# Class & Module Documentation

Starlight documentation sites, based on Astro's static site generation, have a different structure and purpose compared to traditional codebases where comprehensive class and module documentation is common. Tools like Javadoc or Sphinx are primarily designed for documenting code with extensive classes and modules, which is not the typical focus of a static documentation site.

## Considerations

* **Static Nature**: Starlight documentation sites primarily consist of Markdown or MDX content files that are processed and rendered into static HTML pages. While JavaScript may be used for interactive elements or client-side logic, it is not the central aspect of the site's functionality.
* **Content Focus**: The primary objective of the documentation site is to present information and guides to users effectively, rather than providing in-depth documentation of code structure and implementation details.
* **Alternative Approaches**: If your project involves significant JavaScript code with complex classes and modules, consider exploring alternative documentation methods. You might:
    * Create separate documentation for the JavaScript codebase using tools like JSDoc, which is specifically designed for documenting JavaScript code. 
    * Include relevant code snippets and explanations within your Markdown/MDX content files to provide context and clarity for users who need to understand specific code functionalities.
    * Utilize comments and docstrings within your JavaScript code to document individual functions, methods, and classes for developers working directly with the codebase. 

## Recommendations

* Evaluate the complexity and extent of your JavaScript code to determine if dedicated class and module documentation is necessary.
* Choose an appropriate documentation strategy that aligns with your project's structure and the needs of your target audience.
* Ensure that any code-related documentation is clear, concise, and easily accessible to users who require it.
