# Error Codes and Messages

Starlight documentation sites, as statically generated sites, do not typically encounter runtime errors or generate specific error codes in the same way as dynamic web applications or backend services. However, users might still encounter issues or unexpected behavior while accessing or interacting with the documentation.

## Potential Error Scenarios

* **404 Not Found**: This error occurs when a user attempts to access a page that does not exist on the documentation site. This could be due to a broken link, an incorrect URL, or a page that has been moved or deleted. 
* **Broken Links**: Links within the documentation that point to invalid or non-existent resources can result in errors or user frustration. 
* **Browser Compatibility Issues**: While Starlight strives for broad browser compatibility, there might be instances where certain features or styling elements do not render correctly in older or less common browsers.
* **JavaScript Errors**: If your documentation site utilizes JavaScript for interactive elements or client-side logic, errors in the JavaScript code could lead to unexpected behavior or broken functionality. 

## Troubleshooting Strategies

* **Verify URLs**: Double-check the URL to ensure it is correct and points to an existing documentation page. 
* **Report Broken Links**: If you encounter broken links, consider reporting them to the site maintainers or documentation authors so that they can be fixed.
* **Check Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you are using a modern and up-to-date web browser that supports the latest web standards. 
* **Clear Browser Cache**: Clearing your browser cache can sometimes resolve issues caused by outdated or corrupted files.
* **Inspect JavaScript Console**: If you suspect JavaScript errors, open your browser's developer tools and examine the JavaScript console for any error messages that provide insights into the problem.

## Recommendations

* **Provide clear navigation and search functionality**: A well-organized documentation site with intuitive navigation and effective search capabilities can help users find the information they need and reduce the likelihood of encountering 404 errors. 
* **Regularly review and update content**: Periodically review your documentation content to identify and fix broken links, outdated information, or other potential sources of errors.
* **Test across different browsers**: Ensure your documentation site is tested across a range of browsers and devices to identify and address any compatibility issues.
* **Implement error handling for JavaScript code**: Employ proper error handling mechanisms in your JavaScript code to gracefully handle potential errors and provide meaningful feedback to users. 
* **Offer a feedback mechanism**: Provide a way for users to report issues or provide feedback on the documentation, allowing you to identify and address problems promptly.
