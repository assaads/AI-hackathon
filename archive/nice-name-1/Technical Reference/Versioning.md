# Versioning

Versioning plays a crucial role in managing documentation updates and ensuring users have access to accurate and relevant information. While the provided codebase does not specify a particular versioning system, here are some strategies you can consider for your Starlight documentation site:

## Versioning Strategies

* **Semantic Versioning:** Adopt semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) to structure your documentation versions. This involves using a three-part version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to indicate the level of changes introduced in each update.
* **Date-Based Versioning:** Use a date-based approach, such as YYYY-MM-DD or a sequential version number with dates, to identify different documentation versions.
* **Git-Based Versioning:** Leverage your Git repository's commit history and tags to track and manage documentation versions. This allows you to easily revert to previous versions or identify specific changes.

## Documenting Version Changes

* **Changelog:** Maintain a changelog file (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md`) to document the changes introduced in each version of your documentation. This should include new features, bug fixes, and any breaking changes that might impact users. 
* **Version-Specific Documentation**: Consider creating separate branches or tags in your Git repository for each documentation version. This allows users to access documentation specific to the version of your project they are using. 
* **Migration Guides**: For significant updates that introduce breaking changes or require users to modify their usage, provide migration guides that outline the necessary steps to transition to the new version smoothly.

## Communicating Version Updates 

* **Announcements**: Inform users about new documentation versions through release notes, blog posts, or other communication channels.
* **Version Indicators**: Display the current documentation version prominently on the site, making it easy for users to identify which version they are referring to.
* **Version Selection**: If you maintain version-specific documentation, provide a mechanism for users to switch between different versions easily.
