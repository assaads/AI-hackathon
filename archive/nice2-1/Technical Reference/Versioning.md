# Versioning

This Starlight documentation site project is a foundational template for building documentation websites. It does not have its own versioning history or release notes as it's intended to be customized and extended for individual projects.

## Versioning Your Documentation Site

Here are some versioning practices to consider for your documentation site:

*   **Semantic Versioning:** Adhere to semantic versioning principles (https://semver.org/) for your project, using a version format like `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Increment the:
    *   `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes.
    *   `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    *   `PATCH` version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
*   **Release Notes:** Maintain release notes that document the changes introduced in each version. This helps users understand new features, bug fixes, and any breaking changes.
*   **Versioning in the Documentation:** Consider including versioning information within your documentation, allowing users to select and view documentation for specific versions of your project. 
*   **Migration Guides:** For significant version changes, provide migration guides to assist users in transitioning to the new version. 

## Tools for Versioning Documentation

*   **Git:** Utilize Git tags to mark specific releases or versions of your documentation site.
*   **Static Site Generators:** Some static site generators, including Astro, offer features or plugins to manage versioning within the documentation itself.

## Example: Updating to a New Major Version

1.  **Release a new major version:** Increment the `MAJOR` version number and publish the updated documentation site.
2.  **Create a migration guide:** Document the breaking changes and provide instructions for users to update their projects or integrations to be compatible with the new version.
3.  **Maintain previous versions:** Keep previous versions of the documentation accessible for users who may not yet have migrated to the new version.

## Conclusion

Implement a versioning strategy for your documentation site to keep users informed about changes and ensure a smooth transition between versions. Utilize semantic versioning, release notes, and migration guides as needed to provide a clear and organized documentation experience.
