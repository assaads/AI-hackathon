# Accessing How-To Guides

The project structure suggests that how-to guides are located within the `src/content/guides/` directory. Each guide likely resides in its own Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) file.

## Navigating to Guides

1.  **Development server:**

    *   Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
    *   Navigate to http://localhost:4321/ in your web browser. 
    *   Explore the documentation navigation or search for specific guides. The structure may vary based on your Starlight configuration.

2.  **Production build:**

    *   Build the project for production using `npm run build`. 
    *   The generated files will be in the `dist/` directory.
    *   Open the `index.html` file or deploy the `dist/` directory to a web server.
    *   Navigate through the documentation structure to locate the desired guides.

## Example Guide

The codebase includes an example guide at `src/content/guides/example.md`. This file demonstrates the basic structure and content of a how-to guide. You can access it using the methods described above.

## Creating New Guides

To add more how-to guides, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new Markdown or MDX file** in the `src/content/guides/` directory.
2.  **Add frontmatter** at the beginning of the file to specify the title and description:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Your Guide Title
    description: A brief description of your guide.
    ---
    ```

3.  **Write the guide content** using clear and concise language, providing step-by-step instructions and examples.
4.  **Build or run the development server** to view the newly added guide in the documentation. 

## Recommendations

*   **Clear and concise instructions:** Ensure the guide's steps are easy to understand and follow.
*   **Visual aids:** Consider using screenshots or diagrams to illustrate the steps.
*   **Code examples:** Provide relevant code snippets to demonstrate the implementation.
*   **Testing:** Test the guide yourself to ensure accuracy and completeness.
