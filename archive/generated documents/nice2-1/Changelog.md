# Changelog 

## Changelog for Your Documentation Site

This Starlight documentation site project is a starting point for building documentation websites. It does not have its own changelog or release notes as it is intended to be adapted and customized for individual projects.

## Creating a Changelog

Here's how to create and maintain a changelog for your documentation site:

1.  **Choose a format:** Select a format for your changelog, such as:
    *   **Chronological:** List changes in reverse chronological order, with the most recent updates at the top.
    *   **Categorized:** Group changes by category (e.g., New Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements).
2.  **Document changes:** For each release or update, document the following:
    *   **Version number:** The version of the documentation site or the corresponding software project. 
    *   **Date:**  The date of the release or update.
    *   **Changes:** A list of specific changes, including new features, bug fixes, and improvements. 
3.  **Use clear language:** Write changelog entries in a clear and concise manner, avoiding technical jargon and providing enough context for users to understand the changes.
4.  **Highlight important changes:** Use visual cues, such as bold text or icons, to draw attention to significant updates or breaking changes.
5.  **Maintain consistency:** Use a consistent format and style throughout your changelog.

## Tools for Changelog Management

*   **Keep a Changelog:** A popular changelog format with guidelines and recommendations (https://keepachangelog.com/).
*   **Git:** Utilize Git commit messages to track changes and use tags to mark specific releases. 
*   **Changelog Generators:** Explore tools or scripts that automate changelog generation based on Git commit history.
