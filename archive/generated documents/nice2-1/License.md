# License

## License Information

As this Starlight documentation site project is provided as a foundational template and starting point for building documentation websites, it does not have a specific license attached to it. 

## Choosing a License for Your Project

When creating your own documentation site based on this template, it's important to choose an appropriate open-source license if you intend to share or distribute the project publicly. Some popular open-source licenses include:

*   **MIT License:** A permissive license that allows for broad use and distribution, with minimal restrictions.
*   **Apache License 2.0:** Another permissive license that offers similar freedoms as the MIT License, with additional provisions regarding patents.
*   **GNU General Public License (GPL):** A copyleft license that requires derivative works to be distributed under the same license terms.

## Considerations When Choosing a License

*   **Intended use:** Determine how you want others to be able to use and modify your project.
*   **Compatibility:**  If your project builds upon other open-source components, ensure that your chosen license is compatible with the licenses of those components.
*   **Community norms:** Consider the licensing norms within the community or ecosystem of your project. 

## Adding a License to Your Project

1.  **Choose a license:** Select a license that aligns with your project's goals and requirements.
2.  **Include the license file:** Add a file named `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.txt`) to the root directory of your project. 
3.  **Fill in the license details:** Replace the placeholder information in the license file with your project's specifics.
4.  **Reference the license in your README:** Mention the license and provide a link to the license file in your project's README or documentation. 

## Conclusion

While this template project itself doesn't have a license, it's crucial to choose and include an appropriate open-source license when developing your own documentation site based on this foundation. This ensures clarity regarding usage rights and encourages collaboration and contributions within the open-source community.
