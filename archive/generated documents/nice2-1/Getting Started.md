# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the Starlight documentation site project on your local machine. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **Node.js:** Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
*   **npm:** This comes bundled with Node.js. Verify the installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
*   **Git (optional):** While not strictly required, Git is recommended for version control. Download and install it from https://git-scm.com/ if you don't have it already.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):** If you are using Git, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with the actual details of your repository. 

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory using the `cd` command. For example:

```
cd your-project-directory
```

3.  **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the required project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the development server:** Execute the following command to start the Astro development server:

```
npm run dev
```

2.  **Access the site:** Once the server is running, you can access the documentation site in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Project Structure

Familiarize yourself with the project's file structure:

*   `public/`: Contains static assets like favicons.
*   `src/`: 
    *   `assets/`: Stores images and other assets used within the documentation.
    *   `content/`: Houses the Markdown and MDX files that make up the documentation pages. 
    *   `components/`: (Optional) Can be used to store reusable UI components.
    *   `layouts/`: (Optional) Can be used to define layout templates for pages.

## Adding Content

To add new documentation pages, create Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files within the `src/content/docs/` directory. Refer to the existing content for examples of frontmatter usage and content structure. 

## Configuration

The `astro.config.mjs` file allows you to customize various aspects of the site, including the sidebar navigation, site title, and social links. 

## Building for Production

To build the documentation site for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized static files in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Conclusion 

By following these steps, you should have successfully set up and run the Starlight documentation site project. Feel free to explore the codebase, add content, and customize the configuration to suit your needs.
