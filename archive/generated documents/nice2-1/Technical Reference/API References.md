# API Reference

This project focuses on creating a static documentation site using Astro and Starlight. It does not involve the development of any backend services or APIs. Consequently, there is no API reference section applicable to this codebase.

## Documenting APIs in Other Projects

In projects that involve APIs, the API reference section typically includes comprehensive documentation for each API endpoint, covering aspects such as:

*   **Endpoint URL:** The specific URL path of the API endpoint.
*   **HTTP Method:** The HTTP method used to access the endpoint (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **Description:** A clear explanation of the endpoint's purpose and functionality.
*   **Request Parameters:** A list of parameters that can be included in the request, along with their data types and descriptions.
*   **Request Body:** (For POST, PUT, etc.) The expected format and structure of the request body data.
*   **Response Codes:** Possible HTTP response codes returned by the endpoint, indicating success, errors, or other status information.
*   **Response Body:** (For successful responses) The structure and data types of the response body.
*   **Example Requests and Responses:** Practical examples demonstrating how to interact with the API endpoint.

## Tools for API Documentation

Several tools can assist in generating and maintaining API documentation:

*   **Swagger/OpenAPI:** A widely used specification for describing RESTful APIs, often used with tools like Swagger UI for interactive documentation.
*   **API Blueprint:** Another API description language with tools like Apiary for generating documentation.
*   **Postman:** A popular API client that allows you to send requests, inspect responses, and generate documentation from collections of API calls. 

## Conclusion

While this specific project does not have an API reference section, understanding how to document APIs is crucial for projects that involve backend services or external integrations. Utilize appropriate tools and provide clear and detailed information to enable developers to effectively interact with your APIs.
