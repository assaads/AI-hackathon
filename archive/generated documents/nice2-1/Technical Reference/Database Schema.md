# Database Schema

The Starlight documentation site project is built using Astro, a static site generator. It does not involve a backend database for storing content or data. The content of the documentation pages resides within Markdown and MDX files. 

## Static Site Content Management

*   **Content Files:** Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`) files within the `src/content/docs/` directory serve as the source of content for the documentation pages. 
*   **Frontmatter:** Each content file can include frontmatter to define metadata such as the page title, description, and other relevant information. 
*   **Content Structure:** The content within the Markdown or MDX files is written using the respective markup languages, allowing for headings, paragraphs, code blocks, images, and other structural elements. 

## Advantages of a Static Approach

*   **Simplicity:** Eliminates the need for database setup, management, and maintenance.
*   **Performance:** Static files can be served quickly and efficiently. 
*   **Security:** Reduces potential vulnerabilities associated with database interactions.
*   **Version Control:** Content changes can be easily tracked and managed using Git version control.

## Conclusion

The Starlight documentation site project's static nature removes the need for a database schema. Content is managed directly within files, offering simplicity, performance, and security benefits.
