description: Similar to class and module documentation, the current project's scope doesn't necessitate extensive function or method documentation as it primarily utilizes configuration and content files.

# Function and Method Documentation

The codebase provided mainly comprises configuration files for Astro and Starlight, along with Markdown/MDX content files. It does not involve a significant amount of custom-written JavaScript code with complex functions or methods that would require detailed documentation.

## Documenting Functions and Methods

In projects with more substantial JavaScript code, documenting functions and methods typically includes:

*   **Function/Method Name and Description:** Clearly state the name of the function or method and provide a concise description of its purpose and what it accomplishes.
*   **Parameters:** List the parameters accepted by the function or method, including their names, data types, and descriptions. 
*   **Return Value:** Describe the value returned by the function or method, including its data type and meaning.
*   **Exceptions:** Specify any exceptions or errors that the function or method might throw under certain conditions. 
*   **Usage Examples:** Provide code examples demonstrating how to use the function or method effectively.

## Tools for Function and Method Documentation 

*   **JSDoc:** A widely used tool for documenting JavaScript code, including functions and methods. JSDoc comments are embedded within the code and can be used to generate HTML or other formats of documentation.

## Potential Future Documentation 

As you extend the project and incorporate custom JavaScript logic, consider documenting functions and methods related to:

*   **Data fetching:** If you implement functions to fetch data from external sources, document the API endpoints, parameters, and expected response formats.
*   **Data processing or transformation:** If you have functions to process or manipulate data, document their inputs, outputs, and any algorithms or logic involved.
*   **UI interactions:** For functions that handle user interactions or manipulate the DOM, document the events, element selectors, and expected behavior. 

## Conclusion 

While the current codebase doesn't require extensive function or method documentation, it's important to understand the best practices and tools for documenting code effectively. As your project evolves, consider utilizing JSDoc to maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for your JavaScript functions and methods.
