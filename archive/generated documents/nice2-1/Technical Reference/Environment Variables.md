# Environment Variables

While the current Starlight documentation site project does not explicitly use environment variables, they can be a valuable tool for managing configuration settings, API keys, or other sensitive information that you might not want to store directly in your codebase. 

## Using Environment Variables

1.  **Define the variable:** Choose a descriptive name for your environment variable. For example, `API_KEY` or `SITE_URL`.
2.  **Create a `.env` file (optional):** In the root of your project, you can create a file named `.env` to store your environment variables. Each line in the file should have the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`. For instance:

```
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
SITE_URL=https://your-documentation-site.com
```

3.  **Access the variable in your code:** Use `import.meta.env.VARIABLE_NAME` to access the value of the environment variable within your Astro components or other JavaScript code. For example:

```javascript
const apiKey = import.meta.env.API_KEY;
```

4.  **Environment-specific settings:** You can create different `.env` files for various environments (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`) to manage environment-specific configurations. Astro will automatically load the appropriate file based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. 

## Security Considerations

*   **Do not commit `.env` files to version control:**  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in your Git repository.
*   **Use environment variables for sensitive data:** Avoid hardcoding API keys, passwords, or other confidential information directly in your code. 

## Example: Using an API Key

1.  **Define the variable:** Create an environment variable named `API_KEY` to store your API key. 
2.  **Access the key:** In your code, use `import.meta.env.API_KEY` to retrieve the API key when making API requests. 

## Conclusion

Environment variables provide a flexible and secure way to manage configuration and sensitive information within your Starlight documentation site project. Remember to follow security best practices and avoid exposing confidential data in your codebase or version control system.
