# Security Considerations

## Static Site Security

As a static site, the Starlight documentation site inherently has fewer security vulnerabilities compared to dynamic web applications. However, certain security aspects still need to be considered.

## Potential Security Concerns

*   **Content Injection:** While unlikely due to the static nature of the site, ensure proper sanitization of any user-generated content or dynamic data to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exercise caution when including third-party scripts or embedding content from external sources to mitigate XSS risks.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  Select a hosting provider with robust infrastructure to handle potential DoS attacks and ensure site availability. 

## Security Best Practices

*   **Secure Hosting:** Choose a reputable hosting provider that implements security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and DDoS protection.
*   **HTTPS:** Serve your documentation site over HTTPS to encrypt communication between the server and users' browsers. 
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Consider implementing a CSP to restrict the sources of scripts, styles, and other content that can be loaded on your site, reducing the risk of XSS attacks. 
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your Astro, Starlight, and other dependencies up to date to address any known security vulnerabilities. 
*   **Access Control:** If your documentation site contains sensitive information, implement access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

                      |                    |

## Conclusion

While static sites offer inherent security advantages, it's essential to be mindful of potential vulnerabilities and follow best practices to ensure the security and integrity of your Starlight documentation site.
