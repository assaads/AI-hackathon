## Architectural Diagram - Components

Unfortunately, I cannot generate a complete ASCII architectural diagram based on the provided codebase alone. While I can identify some components and their relationships, a comprehensive diagram requires a deeper understanding of the application's logic and functionalities.

# Available Information

Based on the `package.json` file, I can identify the following components:

*   **Astro:** The main web framework used for building the project.
*   **Starlight:** An Astro integration for creating documentation sites.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
*   **Sharp:** An image processing library likely used for image optimization. 
*   **Typescript:** The programming language used in the project.

# Partial Representation

```
+-------+    +-----------+    +-------------+
| Astro |    | Starlight |    | Tailwind CSS |
+-------+    +-----------+    +-------------+
       ^          ^           ^
       |          |           |
   +-------+   +-------+   +-------+
   | Sharp |   |  MDX  |   | Other | 
   +-------+   +-------+   +-------+ 
```

**Note:** This diagram only shows the relationships between Astro and the identified dependencies. The actual interactions and data flow within the application would require more context to depict accurately.

# Recommendations

To create a more comprehensive architectural diagram, I would need additional information such as:

*   **Application functionalities:** Describe the main features and purposes of the application.
*   **Data flow:** Explain how data moves through the system and interacts with different components.
*   **External systems:** Identify any external services or APIs the application connects to.

With this information, I could generate a more accurate and detailed ASCII diagram or recommend appropriate tools for creating visual representations of the architecture.
