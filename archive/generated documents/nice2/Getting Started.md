# Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to get your development environment set up to start working on this project. We will cover installing dependencies, running the development server, and building the project for production.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** This project requires Node.js to manage dependencies and run scripts. Download and install the latest LTS version from https://nodejs.org/.
*   **npm (or another package manager):** While npm comes bundled with Node.js, you can alternatively use yarn or pnpm. 

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  // or yarn install, or pnpm install
    ```

## Development

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```

    This command will start a local development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:4321/. The site will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will create an optimized production build of your site in the `dist/` directory. 

## Project Structure

Here's a basic overview of the project structure: 

*   `public/`: Contains static assets like favicons.
*   `src/`: Houses the source code of the project.
    *   `assets/`: Stores images and other assets used in the project.
    *   `content/`: Contains the Markdown and MDX files that make up the documentation content.
        *   `docs/`: Houses the main documentation files.
        *   `guides/`: Contains guide-style documentation files. 
        *   `reference/`: Contains reference-style documentation files.
    *   `components/`: (If present) This directory would hold any reusable components.

## Additional Notes 

*   **Tailwind CSS:** This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the styles by editing the `tailwind.config.mjs` file.
*   **Starlight Documentation:** The project employs Starlight for building the documentation site. Refer to the Starlight documentation at https://starlight.astro.build/ for configuration options and features.

I hope this provides a good starting point for working with the project. If you have any further questions or require more specific guidance, feel free to ask!
