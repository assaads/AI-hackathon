# Astro: The Foundation

Astro is a modern static site generator that serves as the foundation for this documentation project. It enables you to build fast, content-focused websites using a component-based approach. Astro allows you to leverage UI components from popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, while keeping the HTML output lightweight and optimized for performance. 

# Starlight: Documentation-Specific Enhancements

Starlight is an Astro plugin specifically designed to enhance documentation sites. It provides a set of pre-built components and features tailored for creating organized, visually appealing, and user-friendly documentation. Starlight includes components like:

* **Sidebar**: A customizable navigation sidebar for easy browsing of documentation sections. 
* **Search**: Integration with search solutions like Pagefind to enable users to quickly find relevant information.
* **Page Layouts**: Predefined page layouts for consistent structure and presentation of documentation content.
* **Code Highlighting**: Support for syntax highlighting using Shiki to improve code readability. 
* **Theming**: Options for customizing the visual theme and style of your documentation site. 

# Design Principles 

* **Content-First**: The project prioritizes content by focusing on clear, concise, and well-structured documentation.
* **Performance**: Astro's static site generation ensures fast loading times and optimal performance.
* **Flexibility**: The component-based architecture and integration with various UI frameworks provide flexibility for customization and extension. 
* **User Experience**: Starlight's features and components are designed to create a user-friendly and intuitive experience for navigating and consuming documentation. 
* **Accessibility**: The project aims to adhere to accessibility standards to make the documentation accessible to a wide range of users. 

# Data Flow 

During the build process, Astro retrieves content from Markdown or MDX files, processes it into HTML, and utilizes Starlight components to structure and style the content. The final output consists of static HTML files and assets that are served directly by a web host or CDN.
