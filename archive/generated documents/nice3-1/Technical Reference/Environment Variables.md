## Project Context and Environment Variables 

The provided codebase for the Starlight documentation project does not explicitly define or utilize environment variables within the configuration files. However, let's explore potential use cases for environment variables and how they could be incorporated and documented.

# Potential Use Cases for Environment Variables

* **API Keys and Secrets**: Storing sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, in environment variables rather than directly in code for security purposes.
* **Configuration Options**: Using environment variables to control various configuration settings, allowing for flexibility and easier deployment across different environments (development, staging, production).
* **Feature Flags**: Implementing feature flags to enable or disable certain features based on environment variables, facilitating testing and staged rollouts.

# Implementing and Documenting Environment Variables

## Example Environment Variables 

* **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Stores the API key for OpenAI. 
    * **How to Set**: Set this variable in your terminal session or within a `.env` file using a dotenv library. 
    * **Default Value**: None.

* **`CONTENT_API_URL`**: Specifies the URL of the Content Management API endpoint.
    * **How to Set**: Similar to `OPENAI_API_KEY`, set this variable in your environment or a `.env` file.
    * **Default Value**: A default API URL could be provided, or an error could be thrown if not set. 

* **`FEATURE_FLAG_SEARCH`**: A feature flag to enable or disable the search functionality.
    * **How to Set**: Set this variable to `true` or `false` based on whether you want to enable search.
    * **Default Value**: `false` (disabled by default). 

## Documenting Environment Variables

* **Documentation Location**: Include a section in your project's documentation dedicated to explaining the available environment variables, their purposes, and how to set them.
* **Clarity and Examples**: Provide clear instructions and examples for setting environment variables in different operating systems or using dotenv libraries.
* **Default Values**: Specify any default values that are used if an environment variable is not set.
