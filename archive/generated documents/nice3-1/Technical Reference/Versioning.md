## Project Context and Versioning 

The provided codebase represents a starting point for a Starlight documentation project, and specific versioning information is not included. However, let's outline how versioning and migration could be documented for such a project.

# Versioning Documentation Structure

* **Version History**: A dedicated section or page listing each released version with dates and summaries of the changes introduced.
* **Migration Guides**: For significant changes between versions, provide step-by-step guides on how to migrate existing projects to the new version. This might involve updating dependencies, modifying configuration files, or adjusting custom code. 
* **Deprecation Notices**: Clearly communicate any deprecated features or APIs, providing timelines for removal and suggesting alternative approaches.

# Example Versioning Documentation

## Version 1.1.0 (2023-10-27)

* **New Features**:
    * Added support for dark mode theming. 
    * Introduced a new `Callout` component for highlighting important information. 
* **Bug Fixes**:
    * Resolved an issue where search results were not properly ordered.
    * Fixed a bug causing broken links in the sidebar navigation. 

## Migration Guide: 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

1. **Update Dependencies**: Run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update Astro and Starlight to their latest versions.
2. **Enable Dark Mode**: Follow the instructions in the theming documentation to configure and enable dark mode for your site.
3. **Replace Deprecated Components**: The `Alert` component has been deprecated in favor of the new `Callout` component. Update your documentation pages to use `Callout` instead. 

## Deprecation Notice: `Alert` Component

The `Alert` component is deprecated as of version 1.1.0 and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate your code to use the new `Callout` component, which offers improved styling and functionality.
