title: Test Coverage (Not Applicable)
description: Explanation regarding the absence of test coverage information in the current project.

## Project Context and Testing

The provided codebase primarily focuses on configuration files and Markdown content for a static documentation site built with Astro.  It does not include extensive custom JavaScript code or complex logic that would necessitate unit or integration testing. Therefore, test coverage documentation is not applicable in this specific project context.

# Potential Testing Scenarios

## Custom Components or Utility Functions 

If the project were to incorporate custom Astro components or utility functions with non-trivial logic, implementing tests would be beneficial. Test coverage documentation would then outline:

* **Testing Framework**: The testing framework used (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine). 
* **Test Types**: The types of tests implemented (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
* **Coverage Metrics**: Metrics such as the percentage of code covered by tests, highlighting areas with low coverage that might require additional testing. 
* **Test Reports**: Instructions on how to generate and interpret test reports to assess the overall health and reliability of the codebase. 

## Example Test Coverage Documentation

### Testing Framework: Jest

This project utilizes the Jest testing framework for unit and integration testing of JavaScript code.

### Test Types

* **Unit Tests**: Unit tests focus on testing individual functions or modules in isolation to ensure they behave as expected. 
* **Integration Tests**: Integration tests verify the interactions between different components or modules, ensuring they work together correctly.

### Coverage Metrics

Test coverage is measured using the Istanbul code coverage tool, which provides reports indicating the percentage of code covered by tests. The project aims to maintain a high level of test coverage (ideally above 80%) to ensure code quality and reliability. 

### Generating Test Reports

To generate test coverage reports, run the following command:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
``` 

This command executes the test suite and generates an HTML report in the `coverage/` directory. The report provides detailed information about test coverage for each file and function, allowing you to identify areas that require additional testing.
