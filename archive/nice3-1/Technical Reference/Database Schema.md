title: Database Schema (Not Applicable)
description: Explanation regarding the absence of a database schema in the current project context.

## Static Site Nature and Database Usage

The provided codebase focuses on building a static documentation site using Astro. Static sites, by their nature, do not typically require a backend database as the content is pre-rendered during the build process.  Therefore, a database schema is not applicable in this project's context. 

# Potential Database Scenarios

## Dynamic Content or User Management

If the project were to incorporate dynamic elements, such as user accounts, comments, or personalized content, a database would become necessary. In such cases, the database schema documentation would detail:

* **Tables**: The names and purposes of each table in the database.
* **Columns**: For each table, a description of the columns, including their names, data types, and any constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
* **Relationships**: The relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, and how they are enforced through foreign key constraints. 

## Example Database Schema 

(Illustrative example for a hypothetical user management system) 

**`users` Table**:

| Column    | Data Type | Description                     | Constraints |
| :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------------ | :---------- |
| `id`       | Integer   | Unique user identifier           | Primary Key |
| `username` | String    | Username for login              | Unique      | 
| `email`    | String    | User's email address            | Unique      |
| `password` | String    | Hashed password for authentication |             |

**`comments` Table**:

| Column     | Data Type | Description                                   | Constraints   |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| `id`        | Integer   | Unique comment identifier                     | Primary Key   |
| `user_id`   | Integer   | ID of the user who posted the comment         | Foreign Key   |
| `page_id`   | Integer   | ID of the page the comment belongs to           | Foreign Key   |
| `content`   | Text      | Content of the comment                         |               |
| `created_at` | Datetime  | Date and time when the comment was created    |               |

**Relationships**:

* The `comments` table has a foreign key relationship with the `users` table through the `user_id` column, indicating which user posted each comment. 
* Similarly, the `comments` table has a foreign key relationship with a hypothetical `pages` table through the `page_id` column, associating comments with specific documentation pages.
